	<h1>EYO</h1>
	<p>Taxis waiting down on the streets so
Hurry up I have to go
Looking round you see all the people
Making faces very cold
Carry me away
Far from the circle that never breaks
Hey hey hey hey hey
Going home, going home
Where this road goes I already know
Where everybody cares for one another
And they take you as their sister</p>
<p>[Chorus:]
Eyo o, eyo o
Eyo o, eyo o
Where the children run around
There's laughing in the crowd
I hope it still remains the same
Eyo o, eyo o
Eyo o, eyo o
And there's something in the song
That makes you feel at home
And that's what's calling out my name
Eyo o o, eyo o o.</p>
<p>How long when they're ready for takeoff
Tomorrow I could fly away
How she's scared and small all the way up
You might have a sunny day
Draining of me on stage
Five years of aging I'm not afraid
Hey hey hey hey hey
Going home, going home
Where this road goes I already know
Where everybody cares for one another
And they take you as their brother
[Chorus]O o o o o
Would you take me and embrace me as your own o
Would you take me and embrace me as your own o
