	<h1>The One That Never Comes</h1>
	<p>:  Why you wanna tell me all your secrets
Don't you know I'm a girl who never falls
Why you wanna pour your heart out to me
When you know I hit the road
Every single time it calls</p>
<p>[Chorus:]
Please don't tell me you're falling
Cause I wouldn't know what to do with myself
Please don't tell me you love me
Cause I've been waiting, waiting waiting
For the one who never comes.</p>
<p>I have looked for love in all direction but
You've been here all along so how could it be you
In my dreams this was so very different
But I'm caught off guard and I don't know what to do</p>
<p>[Chorus:]
Please don't tell me you're falling
Cause I wouldn't know what to do with myself
Please don't tell me you love me
Cause I've been waiting, waiting waiting
For the one who never comes.</p>
<p>[Bridge:]
You are the sunshine through my day
You are the laughter when we say
All the things we shouldn't say
When the others left you stayed
Now that the cards have all been played
Baby, let's not walk away</p>
<p>Please don't tell me you love me
Cause I wouldn't know what to do with myself
Please don't tell me you falling
Cause I've been waiting, waiting waiting
For the love, you never came.
Cause wouldn't know what to do with myself
Please don't' tell me you love me
Cause I've been waiting
For the one who never comes
