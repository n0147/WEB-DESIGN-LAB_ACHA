	<h1>Bed of Stone</h1>
	<p>She's been sleeping on a bed of stone
By a window where no light goes
She wakes to the roar of the traffic
Rumbling outside</p>
<p>Then she remembers her dream and smiles
Yes she smiles
On her dress she irons the folds
Same way mama told
Her brothers and sisters
All the way home
Are proud of the way she fights
Hardship alone</p>
<p>[Chorus:]
Some hope but they let go
Some hope but they don't know
Which way will the wind blow
